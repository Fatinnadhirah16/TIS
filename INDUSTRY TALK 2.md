## ✨My Reflection
Attending the industry talk on project management and system development provided valuable insights into how technical knowledge and effective planning work together in real-work projects. The talk highlighted how important it is to plan properly before starting a project.  Proper planning helps prevent mistakes and makes it easier to manage complex systems, while working with a team brings different perspectives that improve problem-solving. Computer science students need to develop these skills before entering industry to be prepared for practical challenges and respond to evolving industry demands.

# 🧠 Design Thinking Project

## Theme: Digital Solutions for the Autism & ADHD Community

👨‍👩‍👧 AutiCare Connect is an online consultation platform developed to address the challenges faced by parents seeking autism therapy for their children. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often require continuous guidance from therapists, but traditional therapy services can be difficult to access due to distance, cost, long waiting lists, and time constraints.

Using a Design Thinking approach, this project focused on understanding the needs of both parents and therapists, empathizing with the challenges in current therapy sessions, and identifying opportunities for improvement. Through ideation and prototyping, the platform was designed to provide multi-camera online consultations, enabling therapists to observe children from multiple angles, improving session quality and therapeutic effectiveness.

# ✨Reflection
This Design Thinking project helped me gain a better understanding of how to solve problems in a structured and meaningful way. By following each phase, I learned how to manage a project step by step. This improved my planning skills and helped me stay organized throughout the project.

One of the main things I gained was user-centered thinking. I learned how to look at problems from the users’ point of view and understand their needs before making decisions. This helped me reduce assumptions and create solutions that are more practical and relevant.

Overall, this project helped me develop skills such as planning, teamwork, creativity, and consistent improvement. These skills can be applied to future academic projects and real-world situations. The Design Thinking process taught me that learning from users and feedback can lead to better and flexible solutions.

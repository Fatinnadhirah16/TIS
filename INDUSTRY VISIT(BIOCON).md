We had oppurtinity to visit Biocon company, one of the largets insuin manufactures in Asia. I went to visit their drug product product manufacturing section.

The process of drug produg:

🧪Formulation
- Drug substance(powder) + chemicals(liquid), it will dissolve and turn into liquid

🍶Filling
- Fill in the bottle with formulation liquid

👀Visual Inspection
- Check the condition wether there are bubbles and dirt inside the bottle

📦Packing
- Consist of penassembly and penpacking

We only allowed to visit packing area due to restricted access and dress code rules. For packing the insulin, they have two machine, IMA and MAERCHESIN. IMA can produce about 100,000/shift while MARCHESIN only produce 50,000/shift.

After finish pen assembly process, they need to put them in an 8°C room for 16 hours before proceeding with pen packing. Following pen packing, the product stored again in an 8°C room for 16 hours. All this procedure needs to be done within 22 days. Otherwise, they need to be discarded. Mr. Jaya said that insulin need to be handled it carefully because it is comsumed by human body. Futhermore, all the rejected insulin will go Department of Environment (DOE) for proper disposal.

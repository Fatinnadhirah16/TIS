# 💻 PC Assembly

**📅 Date:** 12 November 2025

---

🛠️We had oppurtinity to disammble and assemble a PC. The lab instructor gave instruction step-by-step from opening the case until closing it, making us easy to follow.

The detail step:
- Unsrewing the casing
- removing all the cables
- Take out RAM, Power supply, and hard disk

After that, we need to assemble it back in reverse order and required to test the PC to ensure all the components were placed correctly.

## ✨My Reflection
I personally thought this PC assemble was going to be hard because I have no experience in hands-on computer hardware. Luckily, I got nilcelab instructor and friends to help me. Through this PC lab, I can recognize more components inside teh PC. As a computer student, I think this lab session is very important since we need to have more knowledge about computer hardware.
